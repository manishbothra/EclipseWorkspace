resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.hg_3=Payment procedures
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_2=There's a big risk if you're shipping to somebody you don't know well. Most of the businesses do it with agencies they have no good relationship with. There's no guarantee of payment in this case. Well, there are different schemes run by the government of diverse countries to ensure the guarantees for large projects. Better is to take helps from the people who know these methodologies well and provide the best advice.
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_3=Appropriate payment methods play important role in winning the sales against competitors. Also receiving on time full payments, is the top goal of exporters. But international trade consist high risk in achieving this goal. This is why, exporters desire to get paid as soon as an order is placed which is not acceptable by many buyers. So getting payment as soon as products are exported is something most desired by exporters.
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_4=So an appropriate payment method which minimize the payment risk and also easy for buyers must be chosen by the exporters. Trade Service Provider will provide the best advises in choosing the appropriate methods which fits in the figure, for your international trade.Trade Service Provider provide advisory on every methods like-
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.hg_4=Cash in advance
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_5=This method is desired by many exporters because it less credit risk than any other. Exporters get cash in advance the help of escrow services, wire transfers and credit cards. This method can be the first choice of many exporters but there are also some disadvantages with this. Most buyer doesn't find it attractive as they are concerned with the receipt of goods. Thus, there are possibilities of losing the business for exporters who stick to this method.
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.hg_5=Letter of Credit
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_6=Probably the most secure payment method in international trade is letter of credit (LC). Through it, payment of export is committed by the bank on behalf of buyer. For this, all terms and conditions stated in LC must be met as per the documentation. Also its useful when there's difficulty in obtaining the reliable credit information about buyer. It's beneficial for buyer too, as no payment done to exporters before the goods shipped.
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.hg_6=Documentary collections
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_7=In documentary collections (D/C) method, exporters rely on its bank for the payment. Exporter's bank sends documents to importer's bank which releases the documents to buyer for payment. After receiving funds from buyer, bank remits that to exporter's bank. Thus, payment is collected by the exporter's bank. Being less expensive method than LC, D/C doesn't offer limited recourse in case of non-payment.
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.hg_7=Open account
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_8=Open account method is the most advantageous method for importers as it makes the payment due 30-90 days after the products are shipped. But this method contains high payment risk for exporters. These days, many buyers press exporters for open account method of payment. Due to the increased competition, exporters may agree to it, as denying may let the business slipped to their competitors.Trade Service Provider provide best consulting to exporters so that they can decrease the risk of non-payment while using open account payment method.
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.hg_8=Consignment
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_9=Consignment method is very risky for the exporters as, through this method exporter get paid only after the sales for their exported products by distributor to the end customer. There's no guarantee of payment to exporter, but this method helps exporter to be more competitive in the market. It also reduces the other costs like storing and managing inventory. For successful export on consignment, partnership with trustworthy foreign distributor is must. Trade Service Provider can help with selection of such distributor and appropriate insurance.
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.hg_9=Registration of brand
resources.export_from_india.advisory-post-export.pg_10=There're many agents or suppliers who defraud their exporters by sharing their original products to some other cheap and local manufacturers.

resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_1=Trade finance in Export and Import
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_2=This article explains the various methods of payment in international trade
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_3=Introduction
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_4=Clean Payment
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_5=Payment term in any business is a major part of sales contract. Terms of payment in exports and imports plays an important role in international business. For an exporter getting paid on time and in full is the ultimate goal of his business. On the other hand, importers want to choose those methods which contain minimum risk for them. So, in international trade an appropriate method must be chosen carefully which accommodate the needs of both exporter and importer.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_6=The Major methods of payment in international trade are given below:
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_7=Clean Payment
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_8=Documentary Collection
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_9=Letter of Credit (L/C)
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_10=Consignment Sale
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_11=1. Clean Payment Method
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_12=Clean payments are characterised by mutual trust between importer & exporter. In the clean payment method, all shipping documents, including title documents, are handled directly by the trading parties. Clean payment method is inexpensive and uncomplicated method for both parties because the role of banks is limited to clearing funds as required. There are basically two types of clean payments:
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_13=Advance Payment Method
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_14=In this method level of risk for exporter is lowest as they get paid before they ship the goods. It has the highest risk for importer.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_15=Open Account Method
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_16=In open account method, the goods are shipped and delivered to importer before payment is due, usually in 30 to 90 days. This is the most advantageous method for the importer in cash flow and cost terms, but it is consequently the highest risk option for an exporter.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_17=2. Documentary Collection Method
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_18=In this method of payment, the exporter entrusts the handling of commercial and often financial documents to banks and gives the banks all the necessary instructions concerning the release of these documents to the Importer. Collections are subject to the Uniform Rules for collections published by the International Chamber of Commerce under the document number URC 522. However, the banks involved do not provide any guarantee of payment.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_19=There are two methods under documentary collection method:
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_20=a.) D/P or Documents against Payment: In this method, the documents are delivered to the importer only after collecting payment of goods by the importerâ€™s bank.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_21=b.) D/A or Document against Acceptance: In this method, the document are delivered to the importer only against acceptance of drafts.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_22=3.	Letter of Credit or L/C
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_23=L/C is another method of payment in international trade. A Letter of Credit is a written undertaking by the Importerâ€™s bank, known as the issuing bank, on behalf of the Importer, promising to effect payment in favour of the exporter up to a stated sum of money, within a prescribed time limit and against stipulated documents. However, the banks deal only in documents and not in goods. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publishes internationally agreed-upon rules, definitions and practices governing Letters of Credit, called â€œUniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Creditsâ€? (UCP) under UCP 600.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_24=a. Revocable & Irrevocable Letter of Credit
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_25=A revocable L/C can be amended or cancelled without the consent of the exporter. On the other hand, an irrevocable L/C cannot be cancelled or amended without the consent of all parties including exporter.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_26=b. Sight & Term Letter of Credit
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_27=When payment is to be made at the time that documents are presented, this is referred to as a sight Letter of Credit. On the other hand, when the payment is to be made at a future fixed time from the presentation of documents, this is referred to as a term Letter of Credit.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_28=c. Confirmed Letter of Credit
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_29=Under this type of L/C, the Issuing Bank may request the Advising Bank to add its confirmation on the LC. When Advising Bank agreed to add the confirmation, then it will become the Confirming Bank and undertakes to pay the beneficiary (exporter) if all the terms and conditions of the LC are met. Such Undertaking from the Confirming Bank is separate and in addition to the undertaking given by the Issuing Bank.
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_30=4.	Consignment Sale Method
resources.general_trade_resources.payment_methods_in_export_import_trade_text_31=Under this method, the exporter receives the payment only after the goods have been sold by the importer to the end customer. An international consignment transaction is based on a contractual arrangement in which the importer receives, manages, and sells the goods for the exporter and the exporter retains the title to the goods until they are sold. If these goods are not sold then the same is returned to the exporter. Consignment Sale is considered the most risky and time taking method of payment for the exporter.

resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_3=Export documentation is a necessary process that all exporters must pay close attention to, as documentation  requirements vary considerably by country, commodity, and situation. Exporters must prepare all documents withabsolute accuracy. Export Documents not only gives detail about the product and its destination port but are also usedfor the purpose of taxation and quality control <a style="color:#eb4b4b" href="/resources/export-inspection-agency.html">inspection certification</a>.<br/><br/>India took a leap forward in improving 'Ease of Doing Business' by reducing the mandatory documents required for import and export of products such as <a style="color:#eb4b4b;" href="/global/export-Hot-Rolled-Steel-Coil-from-india">hot rolled steel coil</a> to three documents each. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issued a Notification to this effect.<br/><br/> The Department of Commerce had set up an Inter Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship of DGFT to study and recommend ways to reduce the number of mandatory documents required for export and import. The Committee held detailed discussions with all stakeholders and the concerned Departments/ Ministries/Agencies and also visited JNPT to study the ground situation and find ways to minimize the number of documents and reduce transaction costs and time for exports and imports. The Committee submitted its "Trading Across Borders" report to Prime Minister's Office.<br/><br/> As a consequence, after issue of the DGFT's Notification only three documents each would be mandatory documents for export and import. <br/><br/>The following mandatory documents are prescribed for exports and imports of goods from India:
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_4=Bill of Lading/Airway Bill
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_5=Commercial Invoice cum Packing List(Separate Commercial Invoice and Packing List would also be accepted)
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_6=Shipping Bill/Bill of Export
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_7=Bill of Lading/Airway Bill
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_8=A bill of lading is a contract between the between the steamship company and the shipper. B/L is issued by the shipping company and a proof for shipper that the goods are received by the shipping company. The bill of lading confirms that where the goods are delivered, how freight charges will be paid, who is the consignee.<br/><br/> Bills of lading are two types non-negotiable and negotiable. The shipper uses the first type, non-negotiable "straight bills," when consigning the shipment directly to the final buyer. Meanwhile, the shipper uses the second type, negotiable "order bills," when he does not want title to pass to the buyer until certain conditions have been met. In this instance, the specified shipper must endorse the bill of lading before delivery can occur. An order bill of lading must also show the party to be notified at destination.<br/><br/>Order bills of lading play an important part in international transactions, especially when dealing with letters of credit and drafts. Most letters of credit call for "on board" bills of lading, which provide proof to the buyer that the shipment has been placed on board the vessel.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_9=Bill of Lading/Airway Bill
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_10=The airway bill is a non-negotiable instrument. It serves as a receipt for the shipper and issued by the airline or consolidator. The AWB serves as documentary evidence of the conclusion of the contract of carriage, freight bills, certificates of insurance, the customs declaration. AWB indicates that the carrier has accepted the listed goods and obligates itself to carry the consignment to the destination airport in accordance with the conditions listed on back of the original bill. The Airway Bill gives the information about the handling, dispatching and delivering of shipments.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_11=Commercial Invoice
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_12=A commercial invoice is a bill for the goods issued by the seller to the buyer. This invoice must include the dates of billing and shipping, names of exporter or manufacturer, consignee, terms of sale, mode of payment, description of goods, country of origin, packing marks and numbers,numbers of units, price per unit, total price, transportation mode and any other information required by the country of destination. These invoicesare often used by governments to determine the true value of goods when assessing customs duties.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_13=Packing List
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_14=Packing list is the details of all items in the box, crate, pallet, or container, plus the type, dimensions, and weight of the container. Customs officials use this list to check cargo, while buyers use it to inventory  merchandise received. A packing list gives information about the seller, buyer, shipper, invoice number, date of shipment, <a  target="_self" style="color:#eb4b4b" href="/resources/transport-and-logistics.html">mode of transport</a>, carrier, and itemizes quantity. A packing list may serve as conforming document but it is not a substitute for a commercial invoice.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_15=Shipping Bill / Bill of Export
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_16=For goods moving out of country must be approved by customs by mandatory filing of a legal document called shipping bill.Shipping bill contains all required details about the goods planed to export. A shipping bill is issued by the shipping agent and represents some kind of certificate for all parties, included ship's owner, seller, buyer and some other parties. For each one represents a kind of certificate document. Usually the Shipping Bill is of four types and the major distinction lies with regard to the goods being subject to certain conditions which are:
resources.general_trade_resources.export_documents_text_17=Export duty/cess

resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_4=Introduction
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_5=mporting goods for business is a good idea for the growth of business. But one should adopt right strategies for long term growth and profitability which further depends on the knowledge and understanding of importer about the international market and foreign market analysis.
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_6=Now a day, goods are importing from foreign countries at very large scale because it is very profitable business. You have noted down that the household items and equipment you have in your home may be made in West Germany, made in Japan, made in Korea or made in China. You may have clothing from India, shoes from Brazil, a leather wallet from Italy. Your car may be an import; your stereo equipment may be manufactured elsewhere. There are hundreds of items manufactured all over the world, now being used by the Indian consumer. 
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_7=So, if you have ability to sell, the import business might be right for you. All you need is the desire and determination to make it work.
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_8=Supporting Reasons for Import
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_9=There are many supporting reasons which explain why import business and services is growing at such a fast rate:-
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_10=<strong>Availability:</strong> You know that every country has some rich natural sources which other don’t. So, the businessmen have to import those things in their country for the fulfillment of the needs of their country person. For example Bananas in Alaska, Mahogany Lumber in Maine and Ball Park franks in France. India is heavily dependent on crude oil imports with petroleum crude accounting for about 34 percent of the total inward shipments.
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_11=<strong>Status:</strong> Some people like to buy things which are imported from foreign countries because it’s their status symbol. For example: Italian furniture, French perfume, Egyptian cotton, German beer and many other things. It all seems classier when it comes from distant place.
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_12=<strong>Price:</strong> Pricing of imported items is also an important factor. Because price of some products are cheaper than the same manufactured in home country. For example Korean toys, Taiwanese electronics and Mexican clothing, to rattle off a few, can often be manufactured or assembled in foreign factories for far less money than if they were made on the domestic country.
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_13=Import in India
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_14=The income of middle class consumers in India rises and their increasing levels on expenditure on various products has result a faster rising demand of the Indian import business. Imports in India increased to 35740 USD Million in March of 2015 from 28392.30 USD Million in February of 2015. Imports in India averaged 6225.45 USD Million from 1957 until 2015, reaching an all time high of 45281.90 USD Million in May of 2011 and a record low of 117.40 USD Million in August of 1958. An import in India is reported by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India. Major imports of India include cereals, edible oils, machineries, fertilizers and petroleum products, edible oil, sugar, pulp and paper, newsprint, crude rubber and Iron and steel.
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_15=Import Regulatory Body
resources.general_trade_resources.starting_imports_text_16=In India, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) established Exim Policy or Foreign Trade Policy for the matters related to the import and export of goods in India.

resources.general_trade_resources.appointing_a_sales_agents_p_text_1=When someone wants to increase the sales of their products or services either in home or abroad,then appointing a sales agent is very important. A sales agent is a person who has the accurate quality and experience of find customers for you. For this service they get commission on sales that you make to those customers. Thus selling a product through anoverseas agent is one of most cost effective way.<br/><br/>An agent is a person who is authorized or appointed by a manufacturer to sell or distribute his products within a given territory but who is in business for himself, takes title to the goods, and does not act as agent for a principal. Agents create a legal relationship with a third party. Commercial agents enjoy substantial legal protections which are unlike those given to employees. These are set out in the Commercial Agents (Council Directive) Regulations, which were introduced in 1993 to bring the law of agency in the UK into line with other EU member states.<br/><br/> Always remember that if the agent is working in another member state, you may need to consider that country's equivalent legislation.<br/><br/> Once you have decided to appoint a sales agent either in your own country or overseas, you must be sure to have the terms agreed in writing. A good contract will protect you against disputes or loose sales.

Advantage of employing a sales agent is that you can sell your products or services without incurring the expense of maintain a sales force.<br/><br/><strong>Durability of a sales agent:</strong>Sales agents are more stable than other entry-level salespeople.<br/><br/><strong>Experience:</strong>Sales agents give better result because they are more experienced than your in-housesales force and have long and <strong>Saves management time: </strong>Sales agents already have solid relationships with potential buyers, hence it saves the time of the exporter to build own contacts.Sales agents are generally more experienced than in-house employees and need less management and direction.<br/><br/><strong>Sales agents eliminates many costs:</strong>When you appoint  new sale employees to enter in an overseas market you have to train them and you start paying them immediately, but they donâ€™t start paying off for you immediately. Sales agent avoids the recruitment, training, time and payroll costs of using own employees.<br/><br/><strong>Increase in sales: </strong>: Many manufacturers estimated that sales agents increased their sales approximately 70% than in-house sales force. So they prefer to appoint a sales agent than sales employees.<br/>

Before appointing a sales agent, you must keep in mind that your own sales objectives and then work out if you can achieve these through a force of sales agents or if they can only be achieved by in-house employees. Typically, the main deciding point is whether you are willing to give up some control of the sales process in return for lower costs or the more important control is for you the less advantageous it is to appoint a sales agent.

resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_p_text_1=Import duty is a type of indirect tax levied by the government of India on goods imported into India for trade purpose. Import of goods means bringing goods into India from a place outside India. The concept of import duty is very broad and is almost applicable to every product or item imported to India excepting a few goods like food grains, fertilizer, life saving drugs and equipment etc. Indian basic law for levy and collection of customs duty is Customs Act, 1962. It provides information about levy and collection of duty on imports and exports, import/export procedures, prohibitions on importation and exportation of goods, penalties, offences, etc.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_h3_text_2=Import through Sea
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_p_text_2=A state's territorial sea extends up to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) from its baseline. India includes the territorial waters of India which extend up to 12 nautical miles into the sea to the coast of India. Import of goods means bringing goods into India from a coastline outside India.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_h3_text_3=Basic Custom Duty
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_p_text_3=Basic custom duty is a standard tax rate which is applicable to imported goods. The rates of basic custom duty are mentioned in the first schedule of custom tariff act, 1975 which was amended from time to time under Finance Acts. The duty may be fixed either at ad â€“valorem basis or at specific rate basis. It is divided into standard and preferential rates. The Central Government has the power to reduce or exempt any good from these duties.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_h3_text_4=Additional (Countervailing) Duty of Customs
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_p_text_4=Additional Customs Duty (Countervailing Duty) is equal to central excise duty and is levied on imported articles produced in India. An additional CVD may be levied equivalent to sales tax or VAT, not exceeding four percent. If the rate of this duty is on ad-valorem basis, the value for this purpose will be the total of the value of the imported article and the customs duty on it (both basic and auxiliary). If the importer pays all customs duties this duty can be refunded to the importer, the sales invoice indicates the credit is not allowed, and the importer pays VAT/sales tax on the sale of the good.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_h3_text_5=Special additional duty (SAD)
resources.general_trade_resources.import_duties_p_text_5=The special addition duty is the duty paid on the imported goods. SAD is chargeable in lieu of sales tax and the general rate is 4 %. Specific exemption notifications may also be applicable. The special additional duty is leviable on assessable value + basic customs duty + CVD.

resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_1=Either import of export both the business involves risks in it. Risks are the barriers under business. Removal of those barriers is the key of success in any business. Some of the risks in import business are as follows:
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_h4_text_2=Currency Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_2=Payments and receipts in foreign currency are daily occurrence in international trade and exchange rates between most currencies fluctuate regularly because there is a time lag between entering into a contract and making the payment. The trader is always at the mercy of exchange rate fluctuations due to various economic, political and even purely speculative reasons. The currency risk can be reduced by implementing currency risk management solutions.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_h4_text_3=Non-Delivery Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_3=This is the risk of non-delivery of goods or supplier fails to deliver the goods on time which was specified in contract. This risk can be mitigated if the importer makes the import contract very specific, so that importer always has an option of refusing payment if it is apparent that goods have not been shipped by the specific shipment date.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_h4_text_4=Quality Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_4=In some case, supplier delivers the wrong, inferior or substandard goods. The supplier will not deliver the products that have been specified and not at the level of quality expected by the importer.  To deal with such situations, importer must take necessary protective measures in advance. The best method to avoid such situation is to do a credit check on the company. Even before receiving the final product, inspection can be done from the importer side or exporter side or by an independent inspection agency. In case the importer has an agent in the supplier's country it may be possible for closer supervision to be maintained over shipments or importer personally visit them and inspect their premises, plant, and the quality of their output.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_h4_text_5=Credit Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_5=This risk arises due to the non-delivery of goods by supplier after the importer made payment. This could be happen in case the supplier or related parties of payment line become insolvent. For the mitigation of this risk an importer must consider the financial status of the supplier before entering into a contract and also use conditional payment methods such as documentary credit or documentary collection.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_h4_text_6=Transfer Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_6=This risk arises due to change in government regulations, as it prevents or restricts importerâ€™s ability to make payments or exchange foreign currency.  Most of the countries regulate the transfer of money so unexpected regulatory changes may take place between entering and settling a contract. This risk can be reduced by consulting the expert insights into the foreign markets where you trade.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_h4_text_7=Transport Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_7=There is always a risk that your goods will be damaged or stolen while in transit. This could be by deliberately or accidently. So it is advisable that whether the goods are transported by Sea or by Air, they must be insured against transport risk with commercial insurance agencies. Mostly importers will wish to obtain insurance cover from their own insurance company under a 'blanket cover' called an 'Open Policy' thus taking advantage of bulk billing and other relationships.
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_h4_text_8=Risk of Fraud
resources.general_trade_resources.import_risks_p_text_8=There are various types of fraud like documentary fraud, counterpart fraud, insurance scams, cargo theft, scuttling and piracy. Some unscrupulous suppliers attempts to take advantage of importers because of complexity of international trade. Forged documentary credits are always in circulation and fortunately, an experienced trade services officer can detect a dud credit more often than not. The risk of fraud can be minimize by the research potential trading partners, including third parties, to ensure they are reputable and have a proven track record.

resources.general_trade_resources.export_pricing_and_costing_p_text_5=<strong>Absorption costing: </strong>In absorption costing, the full costs (that is, both fixed and variable costs) are absorbed into production.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_pricing_and_costing_p_text_6=<strong>Standard costing: </strong> In standard costing, a cost is predicted in advance of production, based on predetermined standards under a given set of operating conditions. Standard costs are compared with actualcosts periodically, and revised to avoid losses due to outdated costing.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_pricing_and_costing_p_text_7=<strong>Historical costing:  </strong>Historical costing, unlike standard costing, uses actual costs, determined after they have been incurred. Almost all organizations use the historical costing system of accounting for costs.

resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_h2_text_1=Risks in export business
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_1=The assignment of export risk management begins with knowing what the risks are actually. Your first step is therefore to identify the risks in export, types of export risk. Risks are involved in all business transactions either domestic or international. But risks in overseas trade are quite different from domestic trade. More risk is involved during international exports than exporting to domestic market. Therefore, it is essential for the companies which are going to enter in the field of exporting to devote time and money to measure all the risks related to exporting business and setting up risk management plan.<br/><br/>There are many risks and challenges involved in exporting business. Different types of risks involved are:
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_li_text_1=Financial Risk or Credit Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_li_text_2=Poor Quality Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_li_text_3=Transportation Risks

resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_li_text_7=Unforeseen Risks
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_li_text_8=Exchange Rate Risks
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_li_text_9=Sovereign Risk
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_li_text_10=Culture and language risk
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_2=<strong>Financial Risk or Credit Risk</strong><br/><br/>This risk refers to risk of insolvency, non-payment, late payment, default or fraud by foreign buyers. This is incurred because itâ€™s difficult for an exporter to verify the buyerâ€™s creditworthiness and reputation due to larger distances between trading parties. Thus, it is essential for the exporters to collect reports from overseas credit agencies about the financial strength and business reputation of buyerâ€™s firms.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_3=<strong>Poor Quality Risk</strong><br/><br/> This is the risk of rejection of entire shipment after the arrival at importerâ€™s premises due to poor quality of exported goods. So, itâ€™s better to check the quality of goods properly before exporting the same. Sometimes importers may ask a pre-shipment inspection that will be conducted by an independent inspection company or it may be suggesting by the exporter to the importer during the negotiation stage that such an inspection be carried out as part of the contract.  Such an inspection protects both the importer and the exporter. The costs for the inspection are borne by the importer or it may be negotiated that they be included in the contract price.<br/><br/> Alternatively exporting product samples to importer by an international courier company is a good option. But remember final products produced and shipped must be same as product samples.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_4=<strong>Transportation Risks</strong><br/><br/>This is the risk of transferring goods from one country to another. While transporting, there is the risk of theft,damage and possibly the goods not even arriving at all.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_5=<strong>Logistic Risk</strong><br/><br/>Logistics risks relate to risks of international logistics. The exporter must consider all aspects of international logistics, in particular the contract of carriage. This carriage contract is drawn up between a shipper and a carrier (i.e. transport operator) and largely depends on Incoterms 2010.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_6=<strong>Legal risks</strong><br/><br/>This risk arises due to changes in international laws and regulations. They change frequently and are different from country to country. So, it is important for the exporter to drafts a contract in conjunction with a legal firm,in this manner ensuring that the exporter's interests are taken care of. Exporter must be clear about the law and dispute-settlement procedure that will apply to the contract. Great care must be taken in assessing the legal aspects of trade with a particular country.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_7=<strong>Political Risk</strong><br/><br/>This risk arises due to instability of government sector. As a result, government policies changes frequently. Thus, exporters must be persistently aware of the policies of foreign governments in order that they can change their marketing tactics accordingly and take the necessary steps to prevent loss of business and investment. It is important to inform exporters to be aware of government interference in the target market.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_8=<strong>Unforeseen Risks</strong><br/><br/> Unforeseen risks arise due to unexpected occurrence in a country like a natural disaster (earthquake) or terrorist attack. This may completely destroy an export market or exported goods of a company. So, it is important for the exporters to ensure a force majeure clause to be included in any international contract the exporter concludes.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_9=<strong>Exchange Rate Risks</strong><br/><br/> The possibility of exchange rate movement is referred to as â€˜exchange riskâ€™. The exporter must approach the Foreign Exchange division of his bank prior to quoting any prices internationally. Hedging scheme is a strategy that the exporter could follow in order to protect against the influence of exchange rate movements.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_10=<strong>Sovereign Risk</strong><br/><br/> This involves the risk of a country ceasing or restricting access of particular goods into their market. This restriction is place by the use of embargos, tariffs and quotas. Itâ€™s may be due to political reasons.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_11=<strong>Culture and language risk</strong><br/><br/> Cultural and language risk involves in almost all exporting business because both the parties are from different countries. So, their culture, language and taste are different.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_h4_text_1=Managing your risks
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_12=The main purpose of export risk management is to reduce the risks to the most favorable level faced by a company. The way a company manages its export risks is linked to its attitude to risk and to its degree of competitive edge.<br/><br/>A company can manage their export risks by the following ways:
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_13=<strong>Risk Mitigation</strong><br/><br/> For mitigation of their credit risks, companies ask their customers to pay in advance. They may set credit limits and adjust these to reflect their customersâ€™ payment performance.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_14=<strong>Risk Avoidance</strong><br/><br/> By the risk avoidance method companies exported their products only in those countries which are economically risk-proof. Avoiding export risks are not entering markets with political instability or cutting off supplies to customers with a poor payment culture.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_15=<strong>Risk Transfer</strong><br/><br/> Risk transfer means Insurance against export. Insurance cover costs money and reduces margins in export business. Many companies use Letter of Credit (L/C) for securing their payment take out product liability insurance if major losses are a possibility.
resources.general_trade_resources.export_risks_management_p_text_16=<strong>Risk acceptance</strong><br/><br/> Risk acceptance means the exporting company may decide to bear the risk of payment default itself. <br/><br/>Export risk management strategies Accept, Transfer, Avoid and Mitigate offer ways of reducing the risks that exporting companies run. Though, some of the measures also have some costs. <br/><br/>Always remember that periodical checking of the positions of export business ventures in the export risk matrix and amending them if export opportunities and risks change is required.

resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_1=The basics
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_1=When an exporter plan to start international trading, it becomes more important to understand how International currency exchange rates make difference. International currency exchange rates (Forex rate) influenced by various events that happen worldwide. The International currency exchange rates are extremely unpredictable in nature and keep changing swiftly. <br/><br/> The exchange rate at which one currency can be exchange for another between two countries is known as foreign exchange rate. The foreign exchange rate is also known as the FX rate or Forex rate. For example exchange rate of currency between US and India is 1 USD =62.3849 INR.  Later we discuss various topics related to foreign exchange rates.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_2=Spot Exchange Rate
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_2=The rate at which foreign currency is available on the spot is called Spot exchange rate. Spot rate of foreign exchange is very useful for current transactions but it is also necessary to find what the spot rate is.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_3=Forward Exchange Rate
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_3=Exchange rate that prevails in a forward contract for purchase or sale of foreign exchange is called Forward Rate. This rate is settled now but actual transaction of foreign exchange takes place in future.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_4=Method of Quoting Exchange Rates
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_4=The main confusion for those who are new to the currency market is the standard for quoting currencies. In this section, we'll go over currency quotations and how they work in currency pair trades. There are two methods of quoting exchange rates:
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_5=1.	Direct Currency Quote
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_6=2.	Indirect Currency Quote
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_7=<strong>Direct Currency Quote:</strong> In this method, fixed units of foreign currency against variable amounts of the domestic currency are quoted. For example, in the U.S., a direct quote for the Canadian dollar would be US$0.85 =C$1. Now a days bank are quoting rates on direct basis only.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_8=<strong>Indirect Currency Quote:</strong> In this method, fixed units of domestic currency against variable units of foreign currency are quoted. For example, in the U.S. an indirect quote for the Canadian dollar would be US$1=C$1.17. <br/><br/>Most currency exchange rates are quoted out to four digits after the decimal place, with the exception of the Japanese yen (JPY), which is quoted out to two decimal places.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_5=A currency can be either floating or fixed
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_li_text_1=<strong>Fixed Exchange Rate</strong><br/><br/> In a fixed exchange rate system, the government (or the central bank acting on the government's behalf) intervenes in the currency market so that the exchange rate stays close to an exchange rate target. The rate will not fluctuate from day to day, this is also called pegging. China has a fixed / pegged currency. Developing nations can use this system to prevent out-of control-inflation.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_li_text_2=<strong>	Floating exchange rate</strong><br/><br/> In a floating exchange rate system, a countryâ€™s currency is set by the foreign-exchange market through supply and demand for that particular currency relative to other currencies. The more demand the higher the value against another currency and vice-a- versa. So floating exchange rates change freely and are determined by trading in the forex market. The fixed exchange rate and the floating exchange are opposite from each other.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_6=Cross Currency 
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_9=If a currency quote is given without the U.S. dollar as one of its components, then it is called a cross currency. The most common cross currency pairs are the EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF and EUR/JPY. These currency pairs expand the trading possibilities in the forex market, but it is important to note that they do not have as much of a following as pairs that include the U.S. dollar, which also are called the majors.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_7=Bid and Ask 
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_10=Trading in the financial markets, when you are trading a currency pair there is a bid price (buy) and an ask price (sell). These are in relation to the base currency. Bid price is how much the market will pay for the quoted currency in relation to the base currency. Ask price refers to the amount of quoted currency that has to be paid in order to buy one unit of the base currency. For example: USD/CAD=1.2000/5 (here Bid =1.2000 and Ask =1.2005)
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_8=Spreads and Pips 
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_11=A spread is a difference between bid prices and ask price. For example EUR/USD =1.2500/05, the spread would be 0.0005 or 5 pips which is also known as points. The pip is the smallest amount a price can move in any currency quote. In forex market the smallest point change can result in thousands of dollars being made or lost.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_9=Currency Pairs in the Forwards or Futures Markets 
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_12=In a forward market foreign exchange always is quoted against the U.S. dollar. How many U.S. dollars are needed to buy one unit of the other currency is effects the pricing.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_h4_text_10=Factors which influencing exchange rates are as follows: 
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_13=<strong>High interest rates</strong><br/><br/>In foreign countries currency which has higher interest rates makes it more attractive. Investors like to buy this currency because they can lend money to people in that country and make a profit from the extra margin offered by the higher rates. As a result, higher rates increase demand, which increases a currency''s value and vice-a-versa.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_14=<strong>Inflation</strong> <br/><br/>Inflation affects value of a currency. Lower inflation lets you buy more. Actually investors like it because they want to buy that currency which pushes up its value and vice versa.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_15=<strong>Strength of the economy</strong> <br/><br/>Rise and falls of a country''s currency depends on performance of its economy and the reaction of its investors. Higher the demand of a currency pushes the currency''s value up which depends on business activity, employment and GDP.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_16=<strong>Level of government debt</strong> <br/><br/>Higher the government debt, lower the currency''s value.
resources.general_trade_resources.foreign_exchange_rates_p_text_17=<strong>Terms of trade</strong><br/><br/>Terms of trade is a ratio which compares export prices to import prices. If terms of trade increase then demand of that country''s export increase which means more demand for its currency, which increases its value and vice versa.

Agriculture is the simplest form of the natureâ€™s food. The natural food is provided by plants on earth. These plants takes sun-light and convert it into sugars which provide foods for plants. This process is known as photosynthesis. <br/><br/>Agriculture is concerned with the term which is used for growing of crops and for raising livestock for human. Every year, government of India announced some plans and policies for farmers for increasing their crops.
resources.agriculture_h4_text_3= Types of Agriculture:
resources.agriculture_p_text_2=There are  two  types of  agriculture which are as follows:
resources.agriculture_h3_text_1=Industrialized agriculture
resources.agriculture_p_text_3=In this type of agriculture, most of the work is done by the machines. Croping is done by using machines rather than by farmers and animals. This is done by larger machines which are more powerful and work harder within limited times. Industrial agriculture is used for increasing crops. Sometimes it is done by using chemical products like pesticides also. Pesticides is used for killing mosquitoes and pests which are very harmful for crops.
resources.agriculture_h3_text_2=Subsistence Agriculture
resources.agriculture_p_text_4=Subsistence agriculture is totally opposite from industrialized agriculture. This is another type of agriculture scheme which is regularly practiced. In subsistence agriculture, a farmer lives on land and doing work for enough food for his family. Croping is done without using machines and without chemical products. The main objective of this agriculture is to produce enough food for survival for his family.

resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_4=Making the payment
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_5=The time and mode of payment is specified in the contract along with terms and conditions in the very starting point. The payment should be done usually within 30 to 90 days after the import of goods. Following are the methods could be followed in import export.
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_6=Methods of payment
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_7=Cash in advance: 
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_8=The first choice of exporter as they are paid before the shipment and avoid credit risk. The used options for this method include credit cards and wire transfers. On other side, this method is least attractive to importer because it causes cash flow problem for the buyer. Also there's no guarantee if the goods will be sent once the payment is made.
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_9=Letter of Credit: 
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_10=It's the most secure method of payment in international trade. LC is issued by the buyer's bank and ensures the payment to exporter as per the terms and conditions stated on it. In this method exporter doesn't have to worry about the importers financial stability. Also importer doesn't have to face any payment obligation until the products have been arrived.
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_11=Documentary Collection: 
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_12=In this method exporter receives his payment from its bank, which sends his documents and related instructions to importer's bank. Thus payment is collected from the importer by the involvement of banks which collect it in exchange for documents. It uses draft which provides the required instructions about the documents. This method is less expensive than LCs.
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_13=Open Account: 
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_14=This method is advantageous for importer and least attractive to exporter. In this, goods are sent to importer before the payment is made. It requires payment 30 to 90 days later of shipment. Though, it contains high risk for exporter, many exporters agree on this due to the increasing competition in global market. However they can also use the terms like export credit insurance and mitigate the risk of non-payment.
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_15=Closing the Transaction
resources.import.advisory-post-import.txt_16=The final step of import procedure is closing the transaction. There may be some issue with products quality received by importer. In such case, importer can write to exporter and solve the matters. If products have been damaged during the transition, the insurance company will be accountable for the payment.
